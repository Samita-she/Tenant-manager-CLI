# Tenant Manager CLI

A simple offline command-line application to help landlords and caretakers manage tenants, track rent payments, and generate rental reports.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Landlords or caretakers managing multiple rental units often struggle with:
- Tracking tenant move-ins and move-outs
- Recording full, partial, or missed rent payments
- Determining who owes rent (arrears)
- Monitoring occupancy status
- Managing records without depending on cloud services

Manual systems like notebooks or spreadsheets are inefficient and error-prone. This tool aims to solve that.

## ✅ Solution

**Tenant Manager CLI** is a privacy-first, offline Python tool that allows landlords to:
- Add and remove tenants
- Record and track rent payments
- View current rent statuses
- Generate detailed and simple reports
- Search tenants by name or unit

---

## ✨ Features

- View rent payment status and arrears
- Generate tenant reports (paid, partial, unpaid)

- Save and load data locally from `.json` files
